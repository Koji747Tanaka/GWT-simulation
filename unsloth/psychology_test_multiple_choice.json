Differences in cognitive abilities, environmental factors, and genetic makeup can influence behavior, making comparisons and generalizations challenging. Another drawback is the potential influence of anthropomorphism, where human characteristics and emotions are falsely attributed to non-human animals. Researchers must be cautious and avoid projecting human experiences onto animals. Additionally, the use of animals in comparative psychology research raises ethical considerations. Researchers must ensure the well-being and ethical treatment of animals in their studies.

It refers to the gap between a student's current level of performance and the higher level of performance they can achieve with support. The ZPD is seen as an essential area for learning, as it represents tasks that a student can't perform independently but can accomplish with assistance from a teacher or more capable peer. Scaffolding, which involves providing temporary support and gradually reducing it, is a critical teaching strategy utilized within the ZPD to facilitate learning and promote student development.",

While there is recognition that both nature and nurture play significant roles, this debate has implications for understanding individual differences, designing effective interventions, and promoting inclusive education. It highlights the need for considering students' diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and learning styles. Contemporary perspectives acknowledge the interaction between nature and nurture, emphasizing the importance of creating supportive environments that allow all students to reach their full potential.",

It plays a crucial role in working memory, cognitive flexibility, attentional control, and decision making. The DLPFC helps us maintain and manipulate information in memory, switch between tasks or cognitive sets, inhibit unwanted responses, and plan and execute complex behaviors. Dysfunction or damage to the DLPFC can result in deficits in executive functions, such as difficulties with problem-solving, impulse control, and cognitive flexibility.",

            "B: Self-reflection and self-exploration play a significant role in addressing desire discrepancy and sexual dysfunctions. By engaging in self-reflection, individuals can gain insights into their own desires, inhibitions, and beliefs about sex. This self-awareness enhances communication with their partner and promotes a deeper understanding of one's own needs and boundaries. Self-exploration involves exploring one's own body, fantasies, and preferences. It can help individuals overcome inhibitions and discover new ways to experience pleasure and intimacy. By engaging in self-reflection and self-exploration, individuals can take an active role in finding ways to address desire discrepancy and improve sexual satisfaction within the relationship.",
